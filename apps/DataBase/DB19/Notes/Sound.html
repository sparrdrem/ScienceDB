    <h1>Sound | Notes</h1>
    <h2>How does sound energy travel?</h2>
    <p>Travels in the form of sound waves</p>
    <p>There are 2 types of sound waves - transverse and longitudinal waves</p>
    <h2>Transverse Waves</h2>
    <p>Particles vibrate perpendicular to the wave</p>
    <p>This is light</p>
    <h2>Longitudinal Waves</h2>
    <p>The vibration of the particles are parallel to the wave</p>
    <p>Sound waves are longitudinal waves</p>
    <p>These waves can go through solids, liquids, and gasses. It travels the fastest through solids, slower in liquids, or slowest in gasses. This is because solids are denser than liquids and liquids are denser than gasses</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sound travels in all directions. It bounces off of solids. When it hits your ears again, its called echo.</p>
    <p>Sonar - used to detect depth of the seabed</p>
    <p>Echolocation - usualy used for animals that use sounds to detect location.</p>
    <p>Echolocation and sonar is VERY simmilar.</p>
