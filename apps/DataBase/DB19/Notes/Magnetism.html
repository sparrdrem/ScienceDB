    <h1>Magnetism | Notes</h1>
    <p>Magnetism: Force of attration or repulsion cause by the movement of charged particles</p>
    <p>It is not a charge</p>
    <p>It's caused by the movement of a charge</p>
    <h2>Magnetic Poles</h2>
    <p>Magnetic Poles: A region on a magnet which produces magnetic forces</p>
    <p>The poles of a suspended magnet will align themselves to the poles of the earth</p>
    <h2>Magnetic Fields</h2>
    <p>Magnetic Field: The space around a magnet in which a magnetic force is exerted</p>
    <p>-The shape of a magnetic field is revealed by magnetic field lines</p>
    <p>--Directed away from north poles and toward sourth poles</p>
    <p>The strength of magnetic fields are measured in units of Tesla (T)</p>
    <p>Caused by the motion of electric charges</p>
    <p>-Since motion is relative, so are magnetic fields</p>
    <p>Magnets at rest consist of charges in motion</p>
    <p>-Every spinning electron is a tiny magnet</p>
    <p>-Electrons spinning in the same direction produce a stronger magnet</p>
    <h2>Magnetic Domains</h2>
    <p>Clusters of aligned atoms</p>
    <p>Permanent magnets are made by placing materials in strong magnetic fields</p>
    <p>-Aligns the domains</p>
    <p>It is possible to weaken a magnet by dropping or heating it</p>
    <p>-Pushes domains out of alignment</p>
