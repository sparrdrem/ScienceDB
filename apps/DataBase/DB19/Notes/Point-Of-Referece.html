    <h1>Point of Reference</h1>
    <h2>Measuring Distance</h2>
    <p>Distance: the length of a path between two points</p>
    <h2>Measuring Displacement</h2>
    <p>Displacement is independent of the path taken by the object.</p>
    <p>Involves the starting, ending pint, AND DIRECTION. Vector quantity.</p>
    <h2>Adding vectors</h2>
    <p>When the vectors are along the same plane they are added arithmetically.</p>
    <p>Many different methods for adding vectors that do not lie in the same plane.</p>
    <p>Examples on board</p>
    <h2>What is speed?</h2>
    <p>The ratio of distance an object moves to the amount of time it takes to move that distance</p>
    <p>How fast or slow an object is traveling</p>
    <p>Speed is a scalar quantity</p>
    <p>ANYTHING WITHOUT A DIRACTION IS A SCALER QUANTITY</p>
    <h2>Average Speed</h2>
    <p>Defined as the total distance/total time (v=d/t)</p>
    <h2>Instantaneous Speed</h2>
    <p>Not as useful in physical science and harder to calculate</p>
    <p>Defined as the speed at a given moment in time</p>
    <h2>Graphing Motion</h2>
    <p>Distance-Time graph (Distance on y, Time on x)</p>
    <p>The slope of a line on a distance-time graph is the speed</p>
    <p>At what speed is the student walking down the hallway?</p>
    <h2>Speed vs. Velocity</h2>
    <p>Velocity is speed in a direction</p>
    <p>MUST have a direction</p>
    <p>Considered a vector quantity</p>
    <p>ANYTHING WITH A DIRECTION IS A VECTOR QUANTITY</p>
    <h2>Acceleration</h2>
