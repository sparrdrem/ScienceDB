    <h2>What are Universal Forces</h2>
    <p>Electromagnetic, nucear, and gravitational</p>
    <p>Act the same anywhere in the universe</p>
    <p>They act over a distance</p>
    <h2>Electromagnetic Forces</h2>
    <p>Assosiated with charged particles</p>
    <p>Can attract or repel</p>
    <p>Electric Forces: Act between charged objects or particles</p>
    <p>Magnetic Forces: Act on only metals and only certain particles, such as iron. Attraction to negative or positive ends of a magnet or metal. Simple stuffs</p>
    <p>Strong Nuclear Forces: The forces that hold the nucleus of an atom together. 100 times stronger than the electric force of repulsion at 10^-15m</p>
    <p>Weak Nuclear Forces: The same as strong nuclear force, but its weaker and acts in a smaller diameter (10^-18)</p>
    <p>Gravitational Forces: Every object in the universe attracts every other object. It depends upon mass and distance. The closer and the more mass an object is, the more effect gravitaional force, and vice versa</p>
