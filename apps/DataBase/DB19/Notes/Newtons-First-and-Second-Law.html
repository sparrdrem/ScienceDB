    <h1>12.2 - Newton's First and Second Laws of Motion</h1>
    <p>Aristotle incorrectly proposed that force is required to keep an object moving at a constant speed</p>
    <h2>Galileo</h2>
    <p>Galileo concluded that moving objects not subjected to friction or any other force would continue to move indefinetly</p>
    <h2>Inertia</h2>
    <p>Inertia is the tendancy of an object to resist a change in its motion</p>
    <p>An object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to remain in motion with the same speed and direction</p>
