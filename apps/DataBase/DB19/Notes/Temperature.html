    <h1>Temperature Notes</h1>
    <h2>Heat</h2>
    <p>A form of energy</p>
    <p>Measured in calories or joules</p>
    <p>There is no "coldness" energy</p>
    <p>Any object with temperature above zero kelvin has energy</p>
    <h2>Temperature</h2>
    <p>Avg. kinetic energy of the particles</p>
    <p>Measured in C, F, K</p>
    <p>"Hot" and "Cold" are relative terms</p>
    <p>Absolute zero is zero kelvin</p>
    <h2>Heat Transfer</h2>
    <p>Conduction - Requires direct contact or tarticle to particle transfer of energy; usualy occurs in solids</p>
    <p>Convection - heat moves in currents; hot air rises and cold air falls; only occurs in fluids</p>
    <p>Radiation - heat waves travel through empty space, no matter needed; sun</p>
    <h2>Thermal Equilibrium</h2>
    <p>A system is in thermal equilibrium when all of its parts are at the same temperature</p>
    <p>Heat transfers only from high to low temperatures and only until thermal equilibrium is reached</p>
    <h2>Thermodynamics</h2>
    <p>The study of changes in thermal properties in matter</p>
    <p>Follows Law of Conservation of Energy</p>
    <p>1st Law - the total increase in the thermal energy of a system is the sum of the work done on it and the heat added to it</p>
    <p>2nd Law - natural processes tend to increase the total entropy (disorder) of the universe.</p>
