    <h1>Light Notes</h1>
    <h2>Wavelength</h2>
    <p>A way of measuring a wave</p>
    <p>why am i writing this down? i work with electronics/electricity already know this</p>
    <p>Crest=top of wave</p>
    <p>Trough=bottom of wave</p>
    <p>Amplitide=from 0hz to the top of a wave (how tall a wave is)</p>
    <p>Frequency=the speed of a wave - ex: a radio wave has a very low wavelength that can be as big as a building or a human</p>
    <p>Microwave=a lower frequency thats about the length of a bug, used in microwaves</p>
    <p>InfraRed=about the size of a pinhead, heat/remote control lights</p>
    <p>Visible Spectrum=about the size of Protozoans</p>
    <p>Ultraviolet Light=about the size of molecules</p>
    <p>X-ray wavelength=About as long as atoms, making it able to get through some things other than something like bones</p>
    <p>Gamma Wavelength=About the size of an atom nuclei</p>
    <h2>Radio Waves</h2>
    <p>Produced by feeding an electric signal to the mast or antenna of a transmitter</p>
    <p>It has the longest wavelengths in the spectrum</p>
    <p>These waves can be longer than a football field or as short as a football</p>
    <p>Ray's TV reception uses radio waves</p>
    <p>The satelite at Ray's TV - recieves movies via radio waves from a satelite</p>
    <p>TAXI - driver recieves instructions on a CB radio which uses radio waves</p>
    <p>Radio Tower - broadcasts radio signals</p>
    <p>Large Satelite - dish in field - recieves radio waves from distant stars</p>
    <h2>Microwaves</h2>
    <p>Microwaves have wavelengths that can be measured in centimeters</p>
    <p>The longer microwaves, those closer to a foot in length, are the waves we heat our food with in a microwave oven</p>
    <p>They are good for transmitting information from one place to another because microwave energy can penetrate haze, light, rain and snow, clouds, and smoke</p>
    <p>Shorter microwaves are used for radar and the doppler radar used in weather forcasts, Microwaves, used for radar, are just a few inches long.</p>
    <h2>Infrared waves</h2>
    <p>The longer, far infrared wavelengths are about the size of a pinhead and the shorter, near infrared ones are the size of cells, or are microscopic</p>
    <p>The heat that we feel from sunlight, a fire, a radiator, or a warm sidewalk in infrared</p>
    <p>Shorter wavelengths are the ones used by your TV's remote control</p>
    <h2>The Visible Spectrum</h2>
    <p>Cones in our eyes are receivers for these tiny visible light waves</p>
    <p>The Sun is a natural source for visible light waves and our eyes see the refletion of this sunlight off the objects around us</p>
    <p>The color of an object that we see is the color of light reflected. All other colors are absorbed</p>
    <p>Water droplets cause the white light to break apart into seven colors. This is how rainbows work</p>
    <p>Portrait photographers use film sensitive to visible light</p>
    <p>Astronomers look at visible light from planets and stars</p>
    <h2>UltraViolet Waves</h2>
    <p>Astronomers have to put ultraviolet telescopes on satellites to measure the ultraviolet light from stars and galaxies - and even closer things like the Sun</p>
    <p>A tanning booth uses ultraviolet waves to tan our skin</p>
    <h2>X-Ray waves</h2>
    <p>X-ray light tends to act more like a particle than a wave. X-ray detectors collect actual photons of X-ray light.</p>
    <p>The Earth's atmosphere is thick enough that virtually no X-rays are able to penetrate from outer space all the way to the Earth's surface</p>
    <p>X-ray telescopes and detectors are placed on satellites. We cannot do x-ray astronomy from the ground can not be done from Earth.</p>
    <p>Comets emit x-rays</p>
    <p>The Sun also emits X-rays</p>
    <p>Many things in deep space give off x-rays</p>
    <h2>Gamma Rays</h2>
    <p>Gamma-rays are generated by radioactive atoms and in nuclear explosions</p>
    <p>They can kill living cells, a fact which medicine uses to its advantage, using gamma-rays to kill cancerous cells</p>
    <p>Gamma-rays travel to us across vast distances of the universe</p>
    <p>Instruments abord high-altitude balloons and satellites like the Compton Observatory provide our only view of the gamma-ray sky</p>
