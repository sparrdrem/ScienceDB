    <h1>Electricity Notes</h1>
    <p>The protons are positively charged and are found "locked" in the nucleus with the neutrons</p>
    <p>The electrons are negatively charged and are moving around the electron clouds, and are not "locked" into position</p>
    <p>Electricity is the free movement of electrons</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p>Current = the rate of movement of electrons can be measured over a certain amount of time - the speed of which the electricity is moving</p>
    <p>Sometimes, the flow of electrons is slowed down by any number of factors include:</p>
    <p>Materials - what the electrons are moving through</p>
    <p>Temperature - how warm or cold the materials are</p>
    <p>Length - how far the electrons need to move</p>
    <p>Cross section - how wide the area is the electrons are trying to move through</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Batteries and energy</h2
    <p>Electrical Potential Energy (EPE) = a difference between voltage between two points</p>
    <p>Battery - a device that converts chemical potential energy (CPE) to electrical potential energy (EPE)</p>
    <p>Electrical potential energy is changed to thermal energy, light, mechanical energy as the electricity moves through the different materials.</p>
    <p>A circuit is a complete path for the movement of a charge</p>
