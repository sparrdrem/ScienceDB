    <h1>Work, Power, and Machines - Chapter 14 Section 1</h1>
    <h2>What is work?</h2>
    <p>The product of the force applied to an object and the distance through which the force was applied (Force*Distance=Work (w=f*d)</p>
    <p>All or part of the force must act in the direction of the movement</p>
    <h2>Do you do more work when you finish a job quickly?</h2>
    <p>Work does NOT involve time, only force and distance</p>
    <p>No work is done when you stand in place holding an object.</p>
    <h2>The Joule</h2>
    <p>1 newton-meter is a quantity known as a Joule</p>
    <p>Named after British physicist James Prescott Joule</p>
    <h2>Power</h2>
    <p>How quickly work is done</p>
    <p>Amount of work done per unit time.</p>
    <p>If two people mow two lawns of equal size and one does the job in half the time, the person who did it quicker did the same power, but they both did the same amount of work.</p>
    <p>Power=Work/Time (P=W/T)</p>
    <h2>The Watt</h2>
    <p>A unit named after Scottish inventor James Watt</p>
    <p>Invented the steam engine</p>
    <p>P=W/T</p>
    <p>Joules/Second</p>
    <p>1 watt = 1 J/s</p>
    <p>Used to measure power of light bulbs and small appliances</p>
    <p>An electric bill is measured in kW/hrs</p>
    <p>Horsepower (hp) = 745.5 watts</p>
    <p>Traditionally associated with engines. (car, motorcycle, lawn mower).</p>
    <p>The term horsepower was developed to quantify power. A strong horse could move a 750N object one meter in one second.</p>
    <p>Started as "this engine could do the amount of work 6 horses could</p>
    <h2>Machines</h2>
    <p>A device that makes work easier by changing the size, direction, or distance of a force</p>
    <h2>Forces Involved</h2>
    <p>Input force (F_i): Force applied to a machine</p>
    <p>Output force (F_o): Force applied by a machine</p>
    <h2>Two forces, two types of work</h2>
    <p>Work input:</p>
    <p>Work done on a machine.</p>
    <p>Input Force*Input Distance< (F_i*D_i=Input Force)</p>
    <p>Work Output:</p>
    <p>Work done by a machine.</p>
    <p>Output Force*Output Distance (F_o*D_o=Output Force)</p>
    <p>WORK OUTPUT CAN NOT BE GREATER THAN WORK INPUT</p>
    <h2>Mechanical Advantage</h2>
    <p>The number of times a machine multiplied the input force</p>
    <p>MA=F_o/F_i</p>
    <p>TWO TYPES: Ideal and Actual</p>
    <p>IDEAL:</p>
    <p>Involves no friction.</p>
    <p>Is calculated differently for different machines</p>
    <p>Usualy D_i/D_o</p>
    <p>ACTUAL:</p>
    <p>Involves Friction</p>
    <p>Calculated the same for all machines<p>
    <h2>Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Efficiency can never be greater than 100% because of friction</p>
    <p>Some work is always needed to overcome friction</p>
    <p>A percentage comparison of W_o/W_i</p>
    <h2>The 6 Types of Simple Machines</h2>
    <p>The Lever:</p>
    <p>its... its a lever... its just a bar that pivots...</p>
    <p>Fulcrum=the pivot point of a lever</p>
    <p>First Class Lever: the fulcrum is located between the effort and resistance.</p>
    <p>Makes work easier by multiplying effect force AND changing direction</p>
    <p>Ex: Teeter-Totter</p>
    <p>Second Class Lever: Resistance is found between the fulcrum and input force</p>
    <p>Makes work easier by multiplying the input force, but NOT changing direction.</p>
    <p>Ex: A wheelbarrow</p>
    <p>Third Class Lever: Input force is located between the output force and the fulcrum</p>
    <p>Does NOT multiply input force, only multiplies the distance</p>
    <p>Ex: A tennis racket</p>
    <p>Mechanical Advantage of Lever</p>
    <p>Ideal = input arm length/output arm length</p>
    <p>input arm = distance from the input force to the fulcrum</p>
    <p>Output arm = distance from output force to the fulcrum</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Wheel and Axle:</p>
    <p>A lever that rotates in a circle</p>
    <p>A combination of 2 wheels of different sizes.</p>
    <p>Smaller wheel is termed the axle</p>
    <p>IMA = radius of wheel/radius of axle</p>
    <p>The Inclined Plane:</p>
    <p>A slanted surface used to raise an object</p>
    <p>Ex: Ramps, stairs, ladders</p>
    <p>IMA = length of ramp/height of ramp</p>
    <p>Can never be less than one</p>
    <p>The Wedge:</p>
    <p>An inclined plane that moves</p>
    <p>Ex: Knife, axe, razor blade</p>
    <p>MA is increased by sharpening it</p>
    <p>The Screw:</p>
    <p>An inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder</p>
    <p>The closer the threads, the greated the mechanical advantage</p>
    <p>Ex: bolts, augers, drill bits</p>
    <p>The Pully:</p>
    <p>A chain, belt, or rope wrapped around a wheel</p>
    <p>Can either change the direction or amount of effort force</p>
    <p>Ex: flag pole, blinds, stage curtain</p>
    <p>FIXED Pully</p>
    <p>Can only change the direction of a force (MA=1)</p>
    <p>MOVEABLE Pully</p>
    <p>Can multiply an effort force, but cannot move direction. (MA>1)</p>
    <p>IMA=number of supporting ropes</p>
    <p>Compound machine:</p>
    <p>A combination of 2 or more simple machine</p>
    <p>Cannot get more work out of a compound machine than is put in</p>
