    <h1>Warm-Up 2/19/19</h1>
    <h2>What is Newton's 1st Law</h2>

    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 4/4/19</h1>

    <h1>Warm-Up 4/30/19</h1>
    <h2>What is color? Why do we see certain objects as on color of another?</h2>
    <p>Color is a wavelength of the visible spectrum</p>

    <p>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo violet</p>
    <p>If we point a telescope at empty space we may not see anything, but if we use an x-ray telescope we may be able to see something. This is because x-rays travel faster than visible light. This is also true for gamma rays</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 5/3/19</h1>
    <h2>What is one example of how we use each type of electromagnetic radiation?</h2>

    <p>Visible Spectrum: To see</p>
    <p>Ultraviolet: Taking images of far-away planets</p>
    <p>X-Rays: For diagnosing medical problems such as a broken bone</p>
    <p>Gamma rays: For treating cancer</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 5/7/19</h1>
    <h2>What is sound?</h2>
    <p>Sound is vibrations that travel through the air. When these vibrations hit an animals ear, you hear what we call sound.</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 5/8/19</h1>
    <h2>What are the two types of waves and how are they different from eachother</h2>
    <p>Transverse and longitudinal waves</p>
    <p>Transverse waves move perpendicular to the wave. The vibration is in a 90 degree angle from the actual wave.</p>
    <p>Longitudinal waves vibrate and move in the same direction</p>
