    <h1>Warm-Up 1/4/19</h1>
    <h2>Write a description in your own words of velocity</h2>
    <p>Description of how fast an object is moving in a direction</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/7/19</h1>
    <h2>Write a description in your own words of acceleration</h2>
    <p>Changes in how fast you're moving and/or direction</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/8/19</h1>
    <h2>What is the equation for...</h2>
    <p>Speed=Distance/Time</p>
    <p>Velocity=Displacement/Time</p>
    <p>Accelleration=Change in Velocity/Time</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/9/19</h1>
    <h2>What can we say Acceleration, Velocity, and Speed all have in common with one another?</h2>
    <p>They all are different ways to measure motion</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/14/19</h1>
    <h2>Fill in 2 things you learned in your KWL chart</h2>
    <h2>K</h2>
    <p>Speed measurement (MP/H)</p>
    <p>Newton's laws</p>
    <h2>W</h2>
    <p>Does mass affect an object's motion?</p>
    <p>Does volume affect it?</p>
    <h2>L</h2>
    <p>Speed=D/T</p>
    <p>Speed doesn't include direction</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/15/19</h1>
    <h2>Define distance and displacement</h2>
    <p>Distance: The length of the path between two points</p>
    <p>Displaceent: Direction and distance of a straight line from a start and end point</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/24/19</h1>
    <h2>What is acceleration? What is an example of acceleration?</h2>
    <p>Acceleration is how fast something changes in speed and/or direction an object is traveling</p>
    <p>When something is speeding up or slowing down</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/25/19</h1>
    <h2>A car is traveling at 15 m/s. It starts to decelerate steadily. It comes to complete stop in 10 seconds. What is it's acceleration?</h2>
    <p>-15/10=-1.5m/s^2</p>
