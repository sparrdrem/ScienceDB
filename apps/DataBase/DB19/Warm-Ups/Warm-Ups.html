    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/4/19</h1>
    <h2>Write a description in your own words of velocity</h2>
    <p>Description of how fast an object is moving in a direction</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/7/19</h1>
    <h2>Write a description in your own words of acceleration</h2>
    <p>Changes in how fast you're moving and/or direction</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/8/19</h1>
    <h2>What is the equation for...</h2>
    <p>Speed=Distance/Time</p>
    <p>Velocity=Displacement/Time</p>
    <p>Accelleration=Change in Velocity/Time</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/9/19</h1>
    <h2>What can we say Acceleration, Velocity, and Speed all have in common with one another?</h2>
    <p>They all are different ways to measure motion</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/14/19</h1>
    <h2>Fill in 2 things you learned in your KWL chart</h2>
    <h2>K</h2>
    <p>Speed measurement (MP/H)</p>
    <p>Newton's laws</p>
    <h2>W</h2>
    <p>Does mass affect an object's motion?</p>
    <p>Does volume affect it?</p>
    <h2>L</h2>
    <p>Speed=D/T</p>
    <p>Speed doesn't include direction</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/15/19</h1>
    <h2>Define distance and displacement</h2>
    <p>Distance: The length of the path between two points</p>
    <p>Displaceent: Direction and distance of a straight line from a start and end point</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/24/19</h1>
    <h2>What is acceleration? What is an example of acceleration?</h2>
    <p>Acceleration is how fast something changes in speed and/or direction an object is traveling</p>
    <p>When something is speeding up or slowing down</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/25/19</h1>
    <h2>A car is traveling at 15 m/s. It starts to decelerate steadily. It comes to complete stop in 10 seconds. What is it's acceleration?</h2>
    <p>-15/10=-1.5m/s^2</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 1/31/19</h1>
    <h2>A child drops a ball from a window. The ball strikes the ground in 3 seconds. What was the velocity of the ball the instant before it hit the ground?</h2>
    <p>3*9.8=29.4m/s^2 down</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 2/4/19</h1>
    <h2>Please come up with a story that describes the motion in this graph</h2>
    <p>A biker sped up from 0m/s to 20m/s after 5 seconds meaning their acceleration was 4m/s^2. They maintain this speed for 5 seconds, then decelerate from 20m/s to 0m/s after 5 more seconds, making their acceleration was -4m/s^2.</p>
    <hr />
    <h1>Warm-Up 2/5/19</h1>
    <h2>Draw a distance vs time graph that shows this situation:</h2>
    <h2>A girl rides her bike at a speed of 3m/s for 9s, then stops to talk with a friend for 10s then accelerates towards the park to race her friend for 15s.</h2>
