    <h1>Chapter 12 | Section 1</title>
    <p>1.) A force can cause a resting object to more or cause a moving object to accelerate by changing its speed or direction.</p>
    <p>2.) Static, sliding, rolling, and fluid friction.</p>
    <p>3.) Gravity causes objects to accelerate downward, whereas air resistance acts in the direction opposite to the motion an reduces acceleration</p>
    <p>4.) Earth's gravity acts toward toward the center of the earth.</p>
    <p>5.) The combination of an initial forward velocity and the downward verticle forcee of gravity causes the ball to have a curved path.</p>
    <p>6.) </p>
    <p>7.) The shape it has causes the air to move in a weird pattern, making some of it fall faster than the other, therefor making it move in a different direction.</p>
    <p>8.) The coin that was affeced wtih force will hit the floor first.</p>
