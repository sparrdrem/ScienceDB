    <h1>Chapter 12 | Section 3</h1>
    <p>1.) According to Newton's third law of motion, whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object.</p>
    <p>2.) If the product of its mass and velocity is large, it has a larger momentum.</p>
    <p>3.) In a closed system, the loss of momentum of one object equals the gain in momentum of another object - momentum is conserved</p>
    <p>4.) The eagle because it has a larger mass</p>
    <p>5.) They are incorrect. The action force is the oars moving through the water, but the reaction force is the water pushing the boat.</p>
    <p>6.) Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. If you move your leg in the way we do to move, we push against the ground. The ground then pushes against us, moving us forward.</p>
    <p>7.) A lot of the momentum you generate from the jump go into the canoe instead of you. This is because the canoe is able to move more than the ground can. This makes it so you can't jump as easilly on a canoe than the ground.</p>
