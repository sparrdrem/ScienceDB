    <h2>1.)</h2>
    <p>Velocity is a description of both speed and direction of motion. Velocity is a vector.</p>

    <h2>2.)</h2>
    <p>The slope of a line on a distance-time graph is speed.</p>
    
    <h2>3.)</h2>
    <p>Average speed is computed for the entire duration of the trip, and instantaneous speed is measured at a particular instant.</p>
    
    <h2>4.)</h2>
    <p>Two or more velocities add by vector addition.</p>
    
    <h2>5.)</h2>
    <p>It shows instantaneous speed because it doesn't show the average speed across the whole trip or show a direction. Instead, it gives the speed of a particular moment.</p>
    
    <h2>6.)</h2>
    <p>I could record how long it takes the car to roll down however long the ramp is.</p>
    
    <h2>7.)</h2>
    <p>Because, for example, if the slope were 1/2, and the distance was meters and the time was in seconds, I would be traveling 2 meters per second.</p>
    
    <h2>8.)</h2>
    <p>2.16 m/s</p>
    
    <h2>9.)</h2>
    <p>1,500 kilometers</p>
