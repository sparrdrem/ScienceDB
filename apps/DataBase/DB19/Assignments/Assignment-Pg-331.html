    <h2>1.)</h2>
    <p>To describe motion accurately and completely, a frame of reference is necessary.</p>

    <h2>2.)</h2>
    <p>Distance is the length of the path between two points. Displacement is the direction from the starting point and the length of a straight line from the starting point to the end point</p>
    
    <h2>3.)</h2>
    <p>We add displacements using vector additin</p>
    
    <h2>4.)</h2>
    <p>When it is far away and it is coming directly towards you or away from you</p>
    
    <h2>5.)</h2>
    <p>A rope that is pulled tight is more like displacement than a coiled rope because it is a direct path</p>
    
    <h2>6.)</h2>
    <p>Yes because saying a building is x kilometers tall is impractical as most buildings aren't this tall. For example, is someone's house was 10 meters tall, they would say it was 10 meters tall rather than saying it is 0.01 kilometers.</p>
    
    <h2>7.)</h2>
    <p>Distances because instead of saying "it is 5 blocks away", youwould say it is 3 blocks east, then two blocks north.</p>
