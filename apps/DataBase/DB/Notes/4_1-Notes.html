  <h2>Dalton's Atomic Theory</h2>
  <p>All alements are composed of tiny particles called atoms</p>
  <p>Atoms of any one element are different from those of another element</p>
  <p>Atoms of different element combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds</p>
  <p>In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearanged - but never changed into atoms of another element.</p>
