  <h2>Democritus</h2>
  <p>Greek Philospher Democritus (460B.C.-370B.C.) was among the first to suggest the existence of atoms (from the Greek word "atomos")</p>
  <p>Believes atoms were indivisible and indestructible which is incorrect</p>
  <h2>Dalton's Atomic Theory</h2>
  <p>All alements are composed of tiny particles called atoms</p>
  <p>Atoms of any one element are different from those of another element</p>
  <p>Atoms of different element combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds</p>
  <p>In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearanged - but never changed into atoms of another element.</p>
