  <h1>4:1 Notes</title>
  <h2>Democritus</h2>
  <p>Greek Philospher Democritus (460B.C.-370B.C.) was among the first to suggest the existence of atoms (from the Greek word "atomos")</p>
  <p>Believes atoms were indivisible and indestructible which is incorrect</p>
  <h2>Dalton's Atomic Theory</h2>
  <p>All alements are composed of tiny particles called atoms</p>
  <p>Atoms of any one element are different from those of another element</p>
  <p>Atoms of different element combine in simple whole-number ratios to form chemical compounds</p>
  <p>In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearanged - but never changed into atoms of another element.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>"Billard Ball" model</p>
  <p>He pictures the atom as billard (pool) balls, and thought they were completely solid all the way though</p>
  <h2>J.J. Thomson</h2>
  <p>Discovered the electron</p>
  <p>He was the first scientist to show the atom was made of even smaller things</p>
  <p>He used the Cathode Ray Tube to discover electrons</p>
  <p>He discovered electrons because when he passed electricity through the beam, the beam bent up toward the positive side of a magnet</p>
  <h2>Thomson's "Plum Pudding" Atom Model</h2>
  <p>It was a spherical cloud of positive charge with random electrons scattered throughout, like plum pudding</p>
  <h2>Rotherford's Gold Foid Experiment</h2>
  <p>A radioactive source shoots alpha rays at gold foil. Some rays get reflected while others path through. This happens because the alpha particles sometimes hits the nucleus. He knows that since alpha particles are positively charged, something very small but very solid that is also positively charged must be inside the atoms.</p>
  <h2>Rutherford's contribution to the atomic theory</h2>
  <p>The atom is mostly empty space.</p>
  <p>The nucleus is a small, dense corse with a positive charge.</p>
  <h1>Structure of the Atom</h1>
  <p>Atom - the smallest porticle of an element that can exist alone</p>
  <p>-Two regions of an atom</p>
  <p>--Nucleus</p>
  <p>---Center of atom</p>
  <p>---Protons and neutrons</p>
  <p>--Electron "cloud</p>
  <p>---Area surrounding nucleus containing electrons</p>
  <br />
  <p>Proton - positive charge (+), 1 atomic mass unit (amu); found in the nucleus</p>
  <p>-AMU - approximate mass of a proton or a neutron</p>
  <p>Neutron - neutral charge (0), 1 amu; found in the nucleus</p>
  <p>Electron - negative charge (-), mass is VERY small</p>
  <h2>Counting atoms</h2>
  <p>Number of protons in the nucleus</p>
  <p>The number of protons determines identity of the element</p>
  <p>6 = Atomic number</p>
  <p>C = Symbol</p>
  <p>12.011 = Atomic mass</p>
  <br />
  <p>Mass number (atomic mass)</p>
  <p>number of protons + neutrons</p>
  <p>Units are g/mol</p>
  <br />
  <p>Isotopes</p>
  <p>-Atoms of the same element with varying number of neutrons</p>
  <p>Different isotopes have different mass numbers because the number of neutrons is different</p>
