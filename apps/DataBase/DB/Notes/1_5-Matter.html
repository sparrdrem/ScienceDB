Pure Substance = Uniform and definite composition
<br />
                                 - Formed and separated chemically
                                 <br />
    Elements = A substance that cannot be broken down into smaller substances
    <br />
        Atoms = smallest particle that has properties of an element
        <br />
    Compounds = a substance formed when two or more elements chemically combine together
    <br />
Molecules = the smallest unit of a substance that exhibits all of the properties characteristic of that substance (compound)
<br />
    - 2 + atoms chemically combines
    <br />
Mixture = a physical combination of more than one substance
<br />
    Homogeneous = Solution
    <br />
            -Same throughout the entire mixture
            <br />
                    Ex: flat soda, salt water, black coffee
                    <br />
    Heterogeneous = Not uniformly mixed, different parts
    <br />
            -Substances that need to be shaken
            <br />
                    Ex: noodle soup, granites
