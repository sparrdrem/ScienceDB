<h1>Notes - 1-3 Measurment</h1>
<br />
===================
<br />
A Standard Measurment System
<br />
=========================
<br />
Why is there a standard measurment system?
<br />
Using Si allows science to comunicate data easier
<br />
Stands for "International System"
<br />
Base unit for length
<br />
===============
<br />
1 km = 1,000 m
<br />
1 m   = 100 cm
<br />
1 m   = 1,000 mm
<br />
1 cm = 10 mm
<br />
Weight vs Mass
<br />
=============
<br />
Weight:
<br />
    Your weight is a measure of the force of gravity on you
    <br />
    The force of gravity may be more or less on other planets or moons
    <br />
    You would weight about one-sixth of your Earth weight on the Moon
    <br />
    The Newton (N) is the Si unit, the Pound (lb) is the English unit
    <br />

Mass:
<br />
    Mass is the measurment of the amount of matter an object contrains
    <br />
    Mass is not measured by gravity
    <br />
    If you travel to the Moon, the amount of matter in your body (your mass) will not change
    <br />
    Scientists prefer to use mass rather than weight
    <br />
    The Si unit of mass is the kilogram, but grams will be mostly used in this class.
    <br />
Volume:
<br />
    Volume is the amount of space an object takes up
    <br />
    The Si unit of volume is the cubic meter (m^3) but more than likely it will be measured in Liters (L) or millileters (mL)
    <br />
Volume of a Rectangular Solid:
<br />
    Ex: Cereal Box
    <br />
    Volume = Length * Width * Height
    <br />
Volume of an Irregular Solid:
<br />
    Ex: Rock
    <br />
    Submerge rock in water in graduated cylindar and measure the displacement of the water
    <br />
Density:
<br />
    Density is mass per unit volume
    <br />
    Density = Mass/Volume
    <br />
    Si unit of density is kg/m^3. Other common units are g/cm^3 and g/mL.
    <br />
Time
<br />
    The second (s) is the SI unit of time.
    <br />
    1 s     = 1,000 ms
    <br />
    1 min = 60 s
    <br />
    1 h    = 60 min
    <br />
Temperature
<br />
    The SI unit of temperature is the Kelvin (k)
    <br />
    0*C   = 273 k
    <br />
    32*F = 373 k (?)
