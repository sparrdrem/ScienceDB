Notes 2:2 - Physical Properties
<br />
========================
<br />
A physical property is any characteristic of a material that can be observed or measured without changing the compostion of the material
<br />
Examples:
<br />
Viscosity - risistance of a liquid to flowing
<br />
Conductivity - ability of a material to allow heat or electricity to flow
<br />
Malleability - ability of a solid to be hammered without shattering (must be solid)
<br />
Hardness - resistance to scratching (must be solid)
<br />
Melting point - the temp at which a solid turns into liquid
<br />
Boiling point - the temp at which a substance boils
<br />
Density - the ratio of mass to volume (m/v=d)
<br />
Usefulness of physical properties
<br />
==========================
<br />
Physical properties are used to identify a material, to choose a material for a specific purpose or to separate substances from a mixture
<br />
The methods often involve math since many physical properties are discribed by numbers
<br />
Separating Mixtures
<br />
================
<br />
Filtration - separating substances based on the size of the particles (eg. sand from water)
<br />
Distillation - separation of substances based on their boiling points (requires the boiling points to be different from eachother)
