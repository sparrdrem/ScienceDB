Notes - 1:4 Presenting Scientific Data
<br />
==============================
<br />
In order for news to be useful, it needs to be reported in a clear, orgaized matter.
<br />
Scientists organize their data by using data tables and graphs
<br />
Data Tables
<br />
==========
<br />
The simplest way to organize data is to present them in a table. This table relates two variables - an independant and dependant variable.
<br />
Line Graphs
<br />
==========
<br />
A line graph is useful for showing changees that occur in related variables
<br />
    In a line graph, the manipulated variable is generally plotted on the horizontal axis (x)
    <br />
    The responding variable is plooted on the virticle axis (y)
    <br />
Slope = Rise/Run

<br />
An inverse proportion is a relationship in which the product of 2 variables is a constant
<br />
Bar Graphs
<br />
=========
<br />
A bar graph is often used to compare a set of measurements, amounts or changes
<br />
Circle Graph / Pie Graph
<br />
====================
<br />
Compares seperate parts of a whole group

<br />
Scientists can comunicate results by writing in scientific journals or speaking at conferences
<br />
Scientists can also exhange information using web sites, email, or conversations.
<br />
Peer Review
<br />
==========
<br />
Peer review encourages comments, suggestions, questions, and criticism fromr other scientists
<br />
Based on their peers' responces, the scientists who submitted their work for review can then reevaluate how to best interpret their data.
<br />
Assessment Questions
<br />
==================
<br />
Which type of graph is most useful for showing how part of something relates to a whole? Circle
<br />
How does a line graph generally show the relationship between the ind and dep variables?
<br />
Ind: x
<br />
Dep: y
<br />
How do scientists communicate results of scientific investigations?
<br />
Journals
<br />
Why is peer review important?
<br />
Helps detect error or bias
