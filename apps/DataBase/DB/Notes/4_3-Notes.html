  <hr />
  <p>What can appen when an atom absorbs energy?</p>
  <p>An increase in kinetic energy or a phase change</p>
  <h2>Niels Bohr</h2>
  <p>Agreed with Rutherford's model but added something to it</p>
  <p>Energy levels - the possible energies that electrons in an atom can have</p>
  <p>When an atom gains energy an electron may move to a higher energy level</p>
  <p>When it loses the energy, it emits it as light</p>
  <p>No two elements have the same set of energy levels, so they emit different colors of light</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Electron cloud model</h2>
  <p>Electron cloud model - model of the most likely locations for electrons in an atom (deals with probability)</p>
  <p>Orbital - region of space where an elecron is likely to be found</p>
  <hr />
  <h2>Electron configuration</h2>
  <p>Electron configuration - arrangement of electrons in the orbital of an atom</p>
  <p>Ground state - electrons are all in their lowest possible energy levels (most stable)</p>
  <p>Excited state - one or more electrons are in a higher anergy level than usual (least stable)</p>
  <p>Atoms emit light when their electrons return to ground state</p>
