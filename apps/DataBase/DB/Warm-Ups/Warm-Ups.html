		<h1>10/29 Warm-Up</h1>
		<p>The initial temperature of an empty pop can is 20 degrees celcius. The pop can is heated and is then places in a cold environement. This causes the temperature of the gas inside the pop can to change to 12 degrees celcius.</p>
		<p>What is the final volume of the air inside the pop can? (v of 12oz can=355mL (v=355mL))</p>
		<br />
		<p>The same pop can in the previous example starts under normal atmospheric pressure. This is 100.325 kilopascals.</p>
		<p>What is the final pressure inside the pop can?</p>
		<p>P1*V1=P2*V2</p>
		<p>P2=P1*V1/V2</p>
		<p>=(100325)(355)/</p>

		<h1>10/31 Warm-Up</h1>
		<p>What are 6 common phase changes?</p>
		<p>Melting, freezing, vaporization, condensation, sublimation, and deposition are six common phase changes</p>
		<p>Which are exothermic and which are endothermic?</p>
		<p>Endothermic: Melting, vaporization, sublimation</p>
		<p>Exothermic: Freezing, condensation, deposition</p>
		<hr />
		<h1>11/1 Warm-Up</h1>
		<p>What is the heat of fusion?</p>
		<p>The energy needed to melt</p>
		<p>What is the heat of vaporization</p>
		<p>The energy to turn liquid into a gas</p>
		<hr />
		<h1>11/5 Warm-Up</h1>
		<h2>Graph your data from "Investigating Phase Changes"</h2>
		<h2>-Linegraph = time (min) on x-axis, temp (C) on y-axis</h2>

		<h1>11/6 Warm-Up</h1>
		<h2>What grade are oyu going to get on today's test and why?</h2>
		<p>I'm gona get at least a B because I didnt study as much as I normally do. However, I have this down mostly and I should be able to get a B</p>
