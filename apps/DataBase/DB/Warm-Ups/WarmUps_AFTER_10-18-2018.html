		<h1>10/29 Warm-Up</title>
		<p>The initial temperature of an empty pop can is 20 degrees celcius. The pop can is heated and is then places in a cold environement. This causes the temperature of the gas inside the pop can to change to 12 degrees celcius.</p>
		<p>What is the final volume of the air inside the pop can? (v of 12oz can=355mL (v=355mL))</p>
		<p>_____</p>
		<p>The same pop can in the previous example starts under normal atmospheric pressure. This is 100.325 kilopascals.</p>
		<p>What is the final pressure inside the pop can?</p>
		<p>P1*V1=P2*V2</p>
		<p>P2=P1*V1/V2</p>
		<p>=(100325)(355)/</p>
