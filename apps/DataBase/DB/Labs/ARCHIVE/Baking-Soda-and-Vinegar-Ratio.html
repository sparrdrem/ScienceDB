<h1>First Lab - Vinegar + Baking Soda Ratio</h1>
<br />
Question: What ratio of vinegar to baking soda produces the most reaction
<br />
Hypothesis: If I make a 1:1 ratio of vinegar to baking soda, I predict it will produce a bigger reaction than any other ratio
<br />
Independant Variable: Ratio of vinegar to baking soda
<br />
Dependant Variable: Size of reaction
<br />
Controlled Variable: Same containers, time, temprature
<br />
Materials: Styrofoam cup, plastic cup, graduated cylindar, balance, weigh boat, vinegar, baking soda, ruler
<br />
Procedure:
<br />
  1.) Using a balance, measure 20 grams of baking soda in a weigh boat
  <br />
  2.) Using a graduated cylindar, measure enough vinegar to equal mass of baking soda from previous step
  <br />
  3.) Pour vinegar and baking soda into plastic cup
  <br />
  4.) Alow reaction to finish bubbling
  <br />
  5.) Measure final height of vinegar + baking soda after reaction
  <br />
  6.) Repeat steps 1-5 using different ratios of vinegar to baking soda.
  <br />
Conclusion:
<br />
In most cases, the more baking soda the better. However, 3:1 (7cm) proves different by being as high as 1:2 (7cm). In other words, we are going to have to test more in order to make a good conclusion. We forgot to clean up the lab before leaving, and we could have mistakenly put in too much vinegar or baking soda or not wait for the raction to fully finish. We will have to remember to clean up the lab next time.
