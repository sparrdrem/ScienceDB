<h1>Lab 2: Paper Airplane Lab</h1>
<br />
Hypothesys: Because of my horrible paper airplane building skills, I believe my plane will spin out and crash at around 200cm, while the others will go about 400cm.
<br />
Independent Variable: Distance
<br />
Dependent Variable: Plane
<br />
Control Variable: Anything else (floor, for example)
<br />
Procedure:
<br />
1.) Build the paper airplane
<br />
2.) Gently throw outward
<br />
3.) Measure the distance in cm using a meter stick
<br />
4.) Write down the distance in a table
<br />
5.) Repeat 1-4 2 more times
<br />
6.) Calculate Average
<br />
Materials:
<br />
Paper Airplane
<br />
Meter Stick
<br />
Lab Notebook
<br />
Conclusion:
<br />
My plane actually flew more than 2 times as far as I had predicted. I thought it would fly aroud 200cm, but it flew an average of 434.66666...cm, and because plane 1 flew an average of 290cm and plane 3 flew an average of 209, my plane actually flew the farthest. Some errors that may have happened is that I may have measured incorrectly, had a fan on, or typed in the wrong numbers into my calculator. Next time, I will be sure that the fan is off.
