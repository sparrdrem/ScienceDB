        <p>Collisions between particles of a gas and the walls of the container cause the pressure in a closed container of gas</p>
        <h2>2.)</h2>
        <p>Factors that affect the pressure of an enclosed gas are its temperature, volume, and number of particles</p>
        <h2>3.)</h2>
        <p>Raising the temperature of a gas will increase its pressure if the volume of the gas and number of particles are constant</p>
        <h2>4.)</h2>
        <p>Reducing the volume of a gas increases its pressure if the temperature and number of particles is constant</p>
        <h2>5.)</h2>
        <p>Increasing the number of particles will increase the pressure of a gas if the temperature and the volume are constant</p>
