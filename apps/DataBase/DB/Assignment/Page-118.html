  <p>An electron in an atom can move from one energy level to another when the atom gains or loses energy</p>
  <h2>2</h2>
  <p>Scientists use the electron cloud model to discribe the possible locations of electrons around the nucleus</p>
  <h2>3</h2>
  <p>An electron cloud is a good approximation of how electrons behave in their orbitals</p>
  <h2>4</h2>
  <p>The most stable electrion configuration is the one in which the electrons are in orbitals with the lowest possible energies.</p>
  <h2>5</h2>
  <p>It represents the electrons that are too fast to know where they are at one point in time.</p>
  <h2>6</h2>
  <p>The 2 electrons on the first orbital have an energy level of 1 while the 3 electrons on the 2nd orbital have an energy level of 2</p>
  <h2>7</h2>
  <p>Incomplete - the Bohr Model shows that instead of flying around the nucleus randomly, the atoms actually flew around it in fixed circles.</p>
  <h2>8</h2>
  <p>The location of the electrons are unexpected and can never be known as they are too fast to know with 100% certainty. We need to use probability to predict where it is.</p>
