    <h2>1</h2>
    <p>Proton(+), Neutron(0), Electron(-)</p>
    <h2>2</p>
    <p>A proton is in the nucleus, is heavy, and is positivly charged. An electron flies around the nucleus, is light, and negativly charged.</p>
    <h2>3</h2>
    <p>Different number of protons</p>
    <h2>4</h2>
    <p>Different mass numbers because it has a different number of nutrons</p>
    <h2>5</h2>
    <p>Nutrons and protons are in the nucleus. However, a nutron has no charge and a proton has a positive (+) charge.</p>
    <h2>6</h2>
    <p>The electrons and protons cancel eachother out. For example, a heluim atom has 2 nutrons. This means it also has 2 electrons. These cancel eachother out.</p>
    <h2>7</h2>
    <p>Oxygen-17 has 1 more nutron than Oxygen-16</p>
    <h2>8</h2>
    <p>Protons and electrons have a charge, but nutrons don't.</p>
    <h2>9</h2>
    <p>Because 10-12=-2, and you can't have negative nutrons.</p>
